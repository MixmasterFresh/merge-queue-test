# Here's some detail
This is an example repository that contains a simple merge queue. There are some obvious ways to improve this including:
- make it push the in-progress branch such that we can have a separate job or matrix of jobs run for the test step
- add some verification that the branch should be merged(i.e is appropriately approved and the label adder has the correct permissions)
- send messages to slack

That's pretty cool.
